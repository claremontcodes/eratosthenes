// Sidereal time is the measure of the Earth's rotation with respect to distant
// celestial objects. Since sidereal time is based on the Earth's rotation, it
// is useful for incorporating time in calculations regarding positions of
// astronomical bodies, like the sun, when looking from Earth.

// Greenwhich mean sidereal time converts a Julian time to sidereal time at the // prime meridian (longitude 0 degrees), which passes through Greenwich,
// England, where there is a famous observatory.

// The formula for Greenwhich mean sidereal time gmst for a Julian time jt is:
// Greenwich mean sidereal time = GMST0 + GMST1 â‹… jt
function greenwich_mean_sidereal_time(jt) {
  return GMST0 + GMST1 * jt;
}

// Local sidereal time is the same as GMST, but at a position on east or west
// of the prime meridian. It's like GMST in a local timezone.

// The formula for local sidereal time is at a longitude:
// local sidereal time = GMST + longitude (in radians)

// Note: Latitude and longitude values are measured in degrees. But all of
// the formulas and built-in functions in the Math library use radians instead
// of degrees. Remember to convert longitude from degrees to radians!
